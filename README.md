# On The Map
On The Map is the resulting project of the Networking with Swift course as part of the Udacity iOS Development Nanodegree. It allows Udacity students to share their location with other students in the program by dropping a pin on a MapView. Students are then able to add a URL to the map annotation and share this link as a means of further networking with each other.
